## Native App About Women's Football with Android Jetpack and Java

Project developed at the Santander Bootcamp Mobile Developer with guidance from specialist [Venilton FalvoJr](https://github.com/falvojr "Venilton FalvoJr")
Learning how to create a Native Android App using the Java programming language, exploring the most current native components offered by Android Jetpack. We abstracted a solution that presents news about women's football, consumed from a REST API also created during this project challenge. Therefore, we created an App from scratch, using the main market libraries (native and external) and in compliance with Material Design guidelines.
